        <h1>An Attempt to Walk Through Yale's Sculpture Garden On a Rainy Day</h1>
        <h4>The rain provided me with the opportunity to view the sculpture garden through a new and unexpected lens:
            the
            indoors.</h4>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            While I was looking through the glass window and attempting to view each sculpture in the garden, I had the
            chance to research each piece and learn more about its origin. As explained in the article above, this
            sculpture was built by Yale undergrads who had the chance to take a first year seminar that culminated in
            the creation of this pyramid. I originally thought my first attempt to walk through the sculpture garden was
            a fail and that there was no point in viewing a garden through glass, I now can see the benefit that I
            gained through having time to be curious about each piece.

        <h4>The next time I approached the YUAG the weather was perfect. The garden was open again, and I could finally
            walk through, this time outside.</h4>

                    the metal sculptures and onto the grass as I walked through.</h3>

            <p>This audio clip is from my walk to the YUAG. I passed so many birds and could hear them chirping as I walked down high street.</p>



            <!-- Reflection section where I want to compare the two (inside and outside) -->

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">
                The contrasting  sounds contributed to my experiences with each walk. While the indoors sounds were more still and constant, hearing the birds chirping and gravel shift made for an enjoyable walk through the sculpture garden.
